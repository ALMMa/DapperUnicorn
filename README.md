# DapperUnicorn
Based on DapperExtensions, DapperUnicorn is a small library to add basic CRUD operations (Get, Insert, Update, Delete) for your POCOs. It also exposes a predicate system for advanced cases. The goal of this library is to keep your POCOs pure by not requiring any attributes or base class inheritance. It is backwards compatible with DapperExtensions.
